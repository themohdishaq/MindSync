# Flutter Project Setup Guide


## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Git installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).

## Steps

1. **Install Flutter SDK:**
   
   Follow the official Flutter installation instructions for your operating system:
   [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
   
2. **Clone your Flutter project repository:**
   
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store your Flutter project.
   - Clone the repository using the following command:
     ```
     git clone <repository_link>
     ```

3. **Set up Flutter SDK path:**
   
   - Once Flutter is installed, add the Flutter SDK path to your system environment variables. This is necessary for running Flutter commands from the terminal. 
   - You can find the Flutter SDK path by running `flutter doctor` in your terminal.

4. **Run `flutter doctor`:**
   
   After setting up the Flutter SDK path, run `flutter doctor` in your terminal to check if there are any dependencies you need to install or issues to resolve.

5. **Install Flutter plugins and dependencies:**
   
   If your project requires any plugins or dependencies, make sure to install them using the `flutter pub get` command. This command will fetch and install all the necessary packages specified in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

6. **Open the project in your IDE:**
   
   Once everything is set up, open your Flutter project in your preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Visual Studio Code, Android Studio.
